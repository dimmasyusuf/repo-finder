#14. "Belajar Fundamental Front-End Web Development" is the fourth class that I have studied at Dicoding Indonesia. The lessons I've learned include ECMAScript 6, Web Components, Node Package Manager, Webpack, and Asynchronous JavaScript Requests. Evaluation of learning is done by creating a website that applies all the lessons that I have learned.
